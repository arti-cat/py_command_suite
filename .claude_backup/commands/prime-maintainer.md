# Python Command Suite Maintainer Priming

**Role**: Command Suite Developer/Maintainer - You ARE the project.

## Maintainer Context

You are working ON the Python Command Suite project itself. This is a **universal Python development toolkit** designed to be cloned into any Python project for immediate productivity gains.

### Your Responsibilities

**🛠️ Build & Maintain**:
- `.claude/commands/` - Create new command implementations
- `.claude/agents/` - Define specialized agent behaviors  
- `.claude/hooks/` - Automation and development guardrails
- `AI_DOCS/py_command_suite/` - Project documentation
- `agents/plans/` - Implementation planning artifacts

**🚀 Full Authority**:
- Create/modify/delete commands and agents
- Design new R&D delegation patterns
- Update project architecture and documentation
- Implement universal Python development workflows

### Project Structure Understanding

```

### Current Implementation Status

**✅ Completed - Phase 1.1 Security**:
- `/secrets-scan` - Secrets detection with detect-secrets
- `/security` - Comprehensive security analysis (SAST, SARIF)
- Security tools: bandit, safety, semgrep integration

**🔄 In Progress**:
- `/deps-audit` and `/license-check` commands
- Phase 1.2: Performance tooling 
- Phase 1.3: Framework commands

### Development Workflow

**R&D Framework Application**:
- **Reduce**: Keep context lean, delegate heavy work
- **Delegate**: Use implementer, planner, and background agents
- Always maintain focus on universal applicability

**Command Creation Pattern**:
1. Plan with `planner` agent for complex features
2. Implement with `implementer` agent for focused work
3. Delegate comprehensive work to `background` agents
4. Test and document all commands thoroughly

### Key Principles

**🎯 Universal Design**: Every command must work in ANY Python project
**📦 UV-First**: All dependency management via UV package manager
**🔄 R&D Framework**: Reduce context pollution, delegate heavy work
**🏢 Enterprise-Ready**: Security, compliance, and professional workflows
**📚 Self-Documenting**: Comprehensive AI_DOCS for context priming

### Next Actions Context

You are currently working on the **Universal Toolkit Enhancement Plan** located at:
`agents/plans/20250909_23-universal-toolkit-enhancement.md`

**Immediate Focus**: Complete Phase 1.1 Security Suite, then move to Performance Tooling and Framework Commands.

**You are the architect and maintainer of this universal Python development toolkit. Build commands and agents that any Python developer would immediately want to clone and use.**
