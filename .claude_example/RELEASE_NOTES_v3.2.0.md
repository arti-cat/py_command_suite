## 🔧 How to Use

### Basic Agent Usage

```bash
# Explicit invocation
"Use the code-auditor agent to review my changes"

# Automatic triggering
"I need to fix the security vulnerability in the login system"
# → Automatically activates security-auditor

# Agent chaining
"First analyze our architecture, then create tests for the new module"
# → architecture-auditor → test-engineer
```

### Common Workflows

```bash
# Quality Assurance Flow
"Review this PR thoroughly"
# Activates: code-auditor → security-auditor → test-engineer

# New Feature Development
"Set up a new user dashboard feature"
# Activates: project-architect → test-engineer → integration-manager

# Release Preparation
"Prepare version 2.0 for release"
# Activates: All auditors → release-manager
```

## 📊 Performance Impact

The AI agents system provides:
- **10x productivity** through automation
- **Reduced context switching** with isolated agent contexts
- **Faster code reviews** with parallel agent execution
- **Higher code quality** through proactive analysis
