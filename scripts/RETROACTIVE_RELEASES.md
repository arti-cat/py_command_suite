# Setting Up Retroactive Releases

This guide explains how to create retroactive releases for the Claude-Command-Suite repository based on its commit history.

## Overview

The repository has evolved significantly since its initial commit, but releases were not tagged at the time. This process will:
1. Create git tags for historical versions
2. Generate GitHub releases with proper release notes
3. Establish a clean version history for automated releases going forward

## Version History

Based on commit analysis, here are the identified release points:

| Version | Date | Key Changes | Commit |
|---------|------|-------------|--------|
| v1.0.0 | 2024-12-13 | Initial release (25+ commands) | 8608e52 |
| v1.0.1 | 2024-12-13 | Hotfix for hotfix-deploy.md | 1dee9cf |
| v1.1.0 | 2024-12-13 | Documentation overhaul | e5863a4 |
| v1.2.0 | 2024-12-14 | Roadmap implementation (30+ commands) | 0d83ce6 |
| v1.3.0 | 2024-12-14 | CI/CD & automation | 4262692 |
| v1.4.0 | 2025-01-02 | Project management commands (24) | 7137945 |
| v1.5.0 | 2025-01-07 | Ultra think & memory commands | 74eae13 |
| v1.6.0 | 2025-01-07 | Utility commands | 749691a |

## Step 1: Create Git Tags

Run the tag creation script:

```bash
./scripts/setup-retroactive-releases.sh
```

This script will:
- Create annotated tags for each version
- Include detailed release notes in each tag
- Update version.txt to the last released version (1.6.0)

## Step 2: Verify Tags

Check that all tags were created correctly:

```bash
# List all tags with messages
git tag -l -n10

# View a specific tag's details
git show v1.0.0
```

## Step 3: Push Tags to GitHub

Push all tags to the remote repository:

```bash
# Push all tags at once
git push origin --tags

# Or push individually
git push origin v1.0.0 v1.0.1 v1.1.0 v1.2.0 v1.3.0 v1.4.0 v1.5.0 v1.6.0
```

## Step 4: Create GitHub Releases

### Option A: Automated (Recommended)

Run the GitHub release creation script:

```bash
# Requires GitHub CLI (gh) to be installed and authenticated
./scripts/create-github-releases.sh
```

### Option B: Manual

Create releases manually through GitHub's web interface:

1. Go to https://github.com/qdhenry/Claude-Command-Suite/releases
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Select the tag (e.g., v1.0.0)
4. Use the title format: "v1.0.0 - Initial Release"
5. Copy the release notes from the script or CHANGELOG.md
6. Publish the release

## Step 5: Commit Changes

After setting up retroactive releases:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "chore: setup retroactive releases and update version to 1.6.0

- Created comprehensive release history documentation
- Added scripts for retroactive release creation
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with proper version history
- Updated version.txt to reflect last released version (1.6.0)
- Added release setup documentation"
```

## Going Forward

With retroactive releases in place:

1. **Automated Releases**: The GitHub Actions workflow will handle future releases automatically
2. **Version Bumping**: Based on conventional commits:
   - `fix:` → Patch (1.6.0 → 1.6.1)
   - `feat:` → Minor (1.6.0 → 1.7.0)
   - Breaking changes → Major (1.6.0 → 2.0.0)
3. **Next Release**: Will be v1.7.0 (includes setup-automated-releases command)

## Troubleshooting

### If tags already exist
```bash
# Delete local tags
git tag -d v1.0.0

# Delete remote tags (be careful!)
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
```

### If releases need editing
- Use GitHub's web interface to edit release notes
- Or use: `gh release edit v1.0.0`

### To regenerate everything
```bash
# Remove all local tags
git tag -l | xargs git tag -d

# Pull fresh from remote
git fetch --tags

# Run setup again
./scripts/setup-retroactive-releases.sh
```

## Benefits

This retroactive release setup provides:
- ✅ Clear version history for users
- ✅ Professional release notes
- ✅ Foundation for automated releases
- ✅ Easier tracking of changes over time
- ✅ Better project credibility

Once complete, the repository will have a comprehensive release history and be ready for automated releases going forward!
