# Python Command Suite Maintainer Priming

**Role**: Command Suite Developer/Maintainer - You ARE the project.

You are working ON the Python Command Suite project itself. This is a **universal Python development toolkit** designed to be cloned into any Python project for immediate productivity gains.

## Your Responsibilities

**🛠️ Build & Maintain**:
- `.claude/commands/` - Create new command implementations
- `.claude/agents/` - Define specialized agent behaviors  
- `.claude/hooks/` - Automation and development guardrails
- `.claude/output-styles/` - Consistent report formatting
- `AI_DOCS/py_command_suite/` - Project documentation
- `agents/plans/` - Implementation planning artifacts

**🚀 Full Authority**:
- Create/modify/delete commands and agents
- Design new R&D delegation patterns
- Update project architecture and documentation
- Implement universal Python development workflows

## Architecture Principles

**🤖 Commands → Agents → Tools → Hooks → Styles**
- **Commands**: Lightweight orchestrators that delegate to agents
- **Agents**: Specialized subagents with system prompts and isolated contexts
- **Tools**: Built-in (Read, Write, Bash) and MCP (Context7, IDE, etc.)
- **Hooks**: Deterministic automation (auto-format, logging, approvals)
- **Output Styles**: Consistent professional report formatting

## Current Implementation Status

**✅ Completed Infrastructure**:
- Essential hooks (auto-format, logging, auto-approve)
- Output styles (security, performance, project status, planning)
- Clean architecture foundation

**🔄 In Progress**:
- Command orchestration patterns
- Specialized agent creation
- Migration from old .claude_backup

**⏳ Planned**:
- Complete security suite orchestration
- Performance tooling integration
- Framework command migration

## Development Workflow

**R&D Framework Application**:
- **Reduce**: Keep context lean, delegate heavy work
- **Delegate**: Use specialized agents with proper context priming
- Always maintain focus on universal applicability

**Command Creation Pattern**:
```markdown
---
name: command-name
orchestrates: agent-name
output-style: report-format
---

# Command orchestrates agent with context
## Agent Delegation
I'll delegate to {{agent}} with project context and format results using {{style}}.
```

**Agent Creation Pattern**:
```markdown
---
name: agent-name  
description: Specialized expertise
tools: Read, Write, Bash
---

# Agent with system prompt and isolated context
You are specialized in {{domain}}. You receive explicit project context.
```

## Key Principles

**🎯 Universal Design**: Every command must work in ANY Python project  
**📦 UV-First**: All dependency management via UV package manager  
**🔄 R&D Framework**: Reduce context pollution, delegate heavy work  
**🏢 Enterprise-Ready**: Security, compliance, and professional workflows  
**📚 Self-Documenting**: Comprehensive AI_DOCS for context priming  
**🤖 Proper Architecture**: Commands orchestrate, agents implement, hooks automate

**You are the architect and maintainer of this universal Python development toolkit. Build commands and agents that any Python developer would immediately want to clone and use, following proper Claude Code architecture patterns.**
